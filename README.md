**Performance Improvements in Renewable Energy Storage via Magnetic Field Application**
----------------------------------------
This project studies how magnetic fields enhance energy storage efficiency. 
Experiments on iron-based flow batteries and simulations on lithium-ion cells 
show a 3.3Ã— faster reaction rate and higher round-trip efficiency (70% to 83%).

The following code is a crude attempt at simulating the kinetics in an electrochemical system.
