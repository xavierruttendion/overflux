Overflux Electrochemical Simulation
===================================

Overflux models diffusion-controlled electrochemical experiments and provides a PyQt5 desktop UI for exploring the results in real time. The application focuses on cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) experiments and visualises potential, current, and concentration profiles generated from a finite-difference solution of the governing PDEs.
